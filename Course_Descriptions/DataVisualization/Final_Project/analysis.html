        <h1>Analysis</h1>
        <p>The dataset was composed of approximately 80,000 animal records from the Austin Texas animal shelter.  The shelter claims to be one of the biggest no-kill animal shelters in the world.  The goal of my project was to investigate this claim, while creating a tool to visualize their data.  First, I sorted the data by animal type (dogs in one array, cats in the other). </p><center><img src="dogcat.png"></center><p>After this I wanted to count the number of animals that ended up at a certain outcome based on an intake characteristic.  I decided to focus on Intake Type, and Intake Condition primarily to investigate my hypothesis.</p><center><img src="Array1.png"> <img src="Array2.png"></center><p>To get the counts I used a dictionary with Intake Types, and Intake Conditions as keys.  I initialized each value to 0, then for each cat/dog I incremented its value in the dictionary.  With this information, I made a matrix holding each intersection of Intake Type and Intake Condition,  For example, if an animal has Intake Condition 0 and Outcome Type 0, then index 0,0 in the matrix would be incremented.</p><center><img src="matrix.png"></center>
